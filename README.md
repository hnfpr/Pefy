## Data Storage

### Local Storage Structure
All data is stored in browser localStorage with the following keys:
- `financial_dashboard_spending`: Spending entries
- `financial_dashboard_savings`: Savings accounts
- `financial_dashboard_investments`: Investment records
- `financial_dashboard_settings`: App settings and preferences

### Data Backup
Since data is stored locally, consider regular exports:
1. Use the export buttons in the header
2. Save the CSV files to a secure location
3. Consider cloud storage for automatic backup

### Data Migration
To transfer data between devices:
1. Export all data from the source device
2. Import the CSV files on the new device (manual process)
3. Or copy localStorage data directly using browser developer tools

## Customization

### Adding New Categories
1. Go to Spending Tracker
2. When adding an entry, click the "+" button next to the category dropdown
3. Enter the new category name
4. The category will be available for future entries

### Modifying the Monthly Target
1. Go to Dashboard
2. Update the "Monthly Target" field
3. Click "Update Target"
4. Charts and calculations will update automatically

### Theme Customization
The app uses CSS custom properties for theming. You can modify `styles/globals.css` to customize:
- Colors (primary, secondary, accent, etc.)
- Typography (font sizes, weights)
- Spacing and layout
- Component styling

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- All data stays on your device
- No external servers or third-party services
- No tracking or analytics
- Complete privacy and control

### Input Validation
- All numeric inputs are validated
- XSS prevention through proper escaping
- SQL injection not applicable (no database)
- Safe localStorage operations

## Browser Support

- **Firefox**: 88+
- **Safari**: 14+
- **Edge**: 90+

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Data Not Saving**
